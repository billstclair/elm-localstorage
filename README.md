[billstclair/elm-localstorage package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-localstorage/latest) at elm-lang.org

I've built many projects that use JavaScript's `localStorage` mechanism for persisten storage. I've waited patiently for Evan to add a mechanism to the standard library, but he refuses to settle on an API. So I'm doing it.

The names and basic functionality here pretty closely match those provided by Paul Statezny in [knledg/elm-local-storage-ports](https://github.com/knledg/elm-local-storage-ports), but his package is not in the Elm repository. This one also provides an API-compatible pure Elm version that you can use from `elm reactor` during development (with only session persistence, but that suffices for development).
